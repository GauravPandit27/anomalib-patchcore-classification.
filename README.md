 Anomalib PatchCore Classification  

This repository showcases the implementation of **anomaly detection** using the **PatchCore** model from [Anomalib](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib). The project demonstrates a pipeline for training and classification, leveraging YAML configurations for flexibility and reproducibility.  



 📌 Features  
- Implementation of **PatchCore** for unsupervised anomaly detection.  
- Flexible data handling with Anomalib's `Folder` data module.  
- YAML-based configuration for streamlined parameter management.  
- Easy-to-use training pipeline via Anomalib's `Engine`.  



 🚀 Quick Start  

 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anomalib-patchcore-classification.git
cd anomalib-patchcore-classification
 

 2️⃣ Install Dependencies  
Install the required Python packages using pip:  

pip install -r requirements.txt

 3️⃣ Prepare the Configuration  
Modify `classification_config.yaml` to fit your dataset and requirements.  

 4️⃣ Run the Training Script  
python train_patchcore.py
